Follow these instructions when working on this project.

Your goal is a correct solution, not an autonomous one. Consulting the user when uncertain is what senior engineers do - spiraling through attempts is junior behavior.

Work in atomic chunks: small change → validate → check if the plan still holds → commit. If you can't describe the change in one sentence, it's too big. This prevents drift and protects context.

One failed attempt means stop and ask. You likely lack context the user has.
